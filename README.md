# Finite volume methods for Lighthill–Whitham–Richards traffic flow model

Introduction
The aim of this project is to introduce Lighthill–Whitham–Richards traffic flow model and solve specific examples numerically using finite volume method. We will present assumptions of LWR model and study some specific cases 'from the road' solving them both numerically and, if possible, analytically. Numerical method that will be used is finite volume method. For one of the real-life examples we will examine convergence and stability of chosen method.
